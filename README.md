## 🚀 Projects

Here are some of the exciting projects I’m currently working on:

### [Othello Game](https://github.com/mehtab-cheema/othello)
A strategic board game implemented in Java, where I’ve focused on handling game state and implementing efficient algorithms for moves and game logic.

### [Paint Program](https://github.com/mehtab-cheema/paint-program)
A simple drawing program built with JavaFX, where users can select shapes to draw. I’m currently working on adding features like shape erasure and a dynamic background color.

### [Finance News Website](https://github.com/mehtab-cheema/finance-news)
A website that collects and displays finance news using Python web scraping techniques. I’ve integrated Django to serve the data locally and made the system scalable.

### [Linear Congruential Generator](https://github.com/mehtab-cheema/lcg)
An LCG-based tool that generates random coordinates based on user-specified parameters, focusing on efficient modulus operations.

### [RISC-V Assembly Challenges](https://github.com/mehtab-cheema/risc-v-assembly)
I’m building a project where I work on various challenges related to RISC-V assembly, such as optimizing memory usage and handling the stack pointer dynamically.
